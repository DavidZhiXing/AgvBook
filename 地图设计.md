### 地图的格式定义
``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Paths Version="2.0.0">
    <Path No="1" Detail="B;82.380,45.460,0.000;82.663,45.460,0.000" />
    <Path No="2" Detail="F;82.380,45.460,0.000;82.663,45.460,0.000" />
    <Path No="3" Detail="F;82.663,45.460,0.000;82.663,45.460,0.000" />
<Paths />
```

最简单的地图
